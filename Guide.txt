The PostgresSQL server must be installed.

Verify that the password of the ConnectionStrings section of the appsettings.Development.json file of the server project matches the PostgresSQL server password.

To create the required databases (portfolio-db), run the following commands from the Package Manager Console:

	Update-Database -Context AppDbContext	

The client project needs to install node modules (npm install).
